FunctionTemplate
  .InstanceTemplate() => ObjectTemplate

FunctionTemplate is a container for a Function, which is an actual js
function object. A Function can only be called and sorta loosely inspected.
A FunctionTemplate, however, can be used from inside C++ to generate new
objects.

FunctionTemplate has a PrototypeTemplate, but that's the prototype of the
function.

InstanceTemplate is the prototype of the objects that will be generated by
"new"-ing this function.

## node

ObjectWrap.Wrap makes a persistent reference to the passed-in js object,
and stuffs a pointer to this C++ object into the js object. The js object
must have at least 1 "internal field" for storing the C++ pointer.
